# FT-Brillouin microscopy

This repo contains code related to the publication ["Full-field Brillouin microscopy based on an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.02092).

Currently it only contains a script for simulating the precision of Brillouin shift and width measurements as a function of different experimental parameters. More information can be found in the "simulations" folder.
